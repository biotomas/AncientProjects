Simsonman.
It was one of those pleasant summer afternoons. The scorching sun was hidden behind that great snowhite clouds which with the perfectly blue sky allways did impress me. We were walking along the river. A bridge was being built there, everyone used to say it would be finished in a year. It has never been finished. That day the bridge was abandoned. If we had not decided to climb it, that day would have been just another boring summer tuesday.
I suggested that we could race, who would be first on the other shore. Now I wish the response was not positive. I started climbing and I did not notice that an electric drill had been left there. Somehow the drill`s cable came to my hand and pulled it accidentally. It fell on my head (130) and I fell on my cousins head. A fisher found us. We were lying on the green grass by the river unconscious. He thought we were lovers enjoyng the composure of nature and he left us alone. A few moments later we woke up and went home. We both were allright. Only I had pingpong ball 
above my head
